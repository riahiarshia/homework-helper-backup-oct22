# 🔧 FIX: Admin Login Issue

## ❌ Problem Identified

The original script used **bcrypt** hashing, but your admin login system uses **SHA256** hashing. The password hashes don't match!

---

## ✅ Solution: Run the Fixed Script

### Step 1: Upload the Fixed Script

Upload this file to Azure (same way as before):
```
update-admin-credentials-fixed.js
```

**In Kudu Console:**
1. Go to: https://your-app-name.scm.azurewebsites.net
2. Click "Debug console" → "CMD"
3. Navigate to: `/site/wwwroot/`
4. **Drag and drop** `update-admin-credentials-fixed.js`

---

### Step 2: Run the Fixed Script

In the Kudu console command prompt:

```bash
cd /home/site/wwwroot
node update-admin-credentials-fixed.js
```

**You should see:**
```
✅ Admin credentials updated successfully!

📋 Updated Admin Details:
   Username: admin
   Email: support_homework@arshia.com
   Role: super_admin

🔑 Login Credentials:
   Username: admin
   Password: A@dMin%f$7
```

---

### Step 3: Test Login Again

Go to: `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/admin/`

**Login with:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `A@dMin%f$7`

✅ **It should work now!**

## 🔍 What Was Wrong?

**Original Script:** Used bcrypt hashing (modern, secure)
- Hash looks like: `$2b$10$axkGOxhejBkQHEl3ZBjxwu...`

**Your Auth System:** Uses SHA256 hashing (simpler)
- Hash looks like: `8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918`

They're incompatible! The fixed script now uses SHA256 to match your system.

---

## 📝 Technical Details

Your `backend/routes/auth.js` file has:
```javascript
function hashPassword(password) {
    return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password).digest('hex');
}
```

The fixed script now uses the same SHA256 method.

---

## 🔐 Security Note

SHA256 is less secure than bcrypt for password storage. Consider upgrading to bcrypt in the future. But for now, we need to match your current system!
