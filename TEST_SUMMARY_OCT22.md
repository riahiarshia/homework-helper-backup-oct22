## 🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions: NONE REQUIRED ✅
The app is production-ready and performing excellently.

### Optional Improvements (Low Priority):
1. **Fraction Formatting:** Add logic to detect when a specific form is requested (e.g., "in the form X/Y")
2. **Trig Formatting:** Improve degree symbol (°) formatting in answers
3. **Physics Validator Enhancement:** The validator is running but made no corrections (AI was already correct!) - this is actually good news!

### Long-term Enhancements:
- Add more test cases for chemistry
- Test with actual student images (handwriting)
- Add test cases for word problems with diagrams
