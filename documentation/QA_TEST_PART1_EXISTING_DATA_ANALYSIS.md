5. **Validator Testing:** Only 2 validator types tested out of 6 built

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:**

### **Before Full QA Testing:**

1. ‚úÖ **Fix Regex Extraction** (just deployed)
   - Pattern now handles "50 m building" format
   - Needs verification in next test

2. ‚è≥ **Verify Validator Works**
   - Test projectile problem again
   - Confirm logs show: "üìê Kinematics values: h‚ÇÄ=50m, v‚ÇÄ=20m/s"
   - Confirm correction: "üîß Step X: Time 5.0s ‚Üí 5.8s"

3. ‚è≥ **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Need tests for ALL subjects
   - Need tests for ALL grades (K-12)
   - Need 4 unique problems per subject
   - Need consistency testing

## üìã **READINESS FOR FULL QA:**

| Component | Status | Ready? |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Math Validators | ‚úÖ Working | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Physics Validators | ‚ö†Ô∏è Deployed, needs verification | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending |
| Chemistry Validators | ‚úÖ Built, untested | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs testing |
| English/Social Studies | ‚ùå No validators (AI only) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky |
| Test Framework | ‚ùå Not created yet | ‚ùå No |
| Test Problems | ‚ùå Need 50+ unique problems | ‚ùå No |
| Baseline Metrics | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 4 tests so far | ‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient |

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION:**

### **Next Steps (In Order):**

1. **Verify Physics Validator** (5 min)
   - Test projectile problem one more time
   - Confirm 5.8s output

2. **Create Test Framework** (30 min)
   - Design 50+ test problems
   - Cover all subjects and grades
   - Define evaluation rubrics

3. **Run Comprehensive Tests** (2-3 hours)
   - 4 problems √ó 5 subjects = 20 tests minimum
   - Each problem tested 4 times = 80 total test runs
   - Log all results

4. **Analyze and Report** (30 min)
   - Statistical analysis
   - Identify patterns
   - Recommend improvements

---

## üìä **CURRENT STATE: NOT READY FOR FULL QA**

**Reason:** Insufficient baseline data, validator verification pending, test framework not built.

**Proceed to Part 2:** Create comprehensive test framework with 50+ problems covering K-12 all subjects.
