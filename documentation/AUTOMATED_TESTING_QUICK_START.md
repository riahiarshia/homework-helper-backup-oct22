# 🚀 AUTOMATED QA TESTING - QUICK START

## ✅ **COMPLETE! Ready to Test**

---

## 🎯 **ONE COMMAND TO RUN ALL TESTS:**

```bash
cd /Users/ar616n/Documents/ios-app/backup-restore/tests
./run-automated-tests.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
1. ✅ Start Azure log stream monitoring
2. ✅ Run 26 automated tests
3. ✅ Capture validator activity 
4. ✅ Generate 5 comprehensive reports
5. ✅ **Verify validators are actually working!** ⭐

---

## 📊 **WHAT YOU GET**

### **In `test-results/` folder:**

1. **`QA_FINAL_REPORT.md`** - Main results
   - Overall pass/fail stats
   - Detailed test results
   - Critical findings

2. **`validator-analysis-*.txt`** - ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT!**
   ```
   🔬 Universal Physics Validator:
     ✅ DETECTED
     ✅ Value extraction working
     📐 Kinematics values: h₀=50m, v₀=20m/s
     ✅ Corrections made
     🔧 Step 1: Time 5.0s → 5.8s
   ```
   **This tells you if validators are actually running!**

3. **`azure-logs-*.log`** - Full Azure logs
4. **`qa-test-results.json`** - Raw test data
5. **`test-output-*.log`** - Test execution log

---

## 🔍 **VERIFYING VALIDATORS WORK**

### **After running tests, check:**

```bash
cat test-results/latest-validator-analysis.txt
```

### **Look for:**
```
🔬 Universal Physics Validator:
  ✅ DETECTED              ← Must see this!
  Activations: 2           ← Should be >0
  ✅ Value extraction working  ← Must see this!
  ✅ Corrections made      ← Must see this!
```

### **If you see "❌ NOT DETECTED":**
- Validator isn't running
- Need to debug deployment
- Check Azure logs for errors

---

## 🧪 **WHAT'S BEING TESTED**

### **26 Test Cases:**
- **16 Math tests** (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-10, 11-12)
- **2 Science/Physics tests** (including critical Test 10A!)

### **Critical Test (Must Pass!):**
**Test 10A: Projectile Motion**
- Problem: "Projectile from 50m building, 20 m/s velocity"
- Expected Answer: **5.8 seconds** (not 5.0!)
- Validator MUST be active
- Must show corrections: "5.0s → 5.8s"

---

## ⏱️ **TIME & COST**

- **Time:** 2-3 minutes
- **Cost:** ~$0.20 (OpenAI API calls)
- **No iOS app needed!** 🎉

---

## 📈 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **✅ PASS if:**
- Overall pass rate ≥75%
- Test 10A shows 5.8 seconds ✅
- Validator analysis shows "✅ DETECTED"
- Corrections are being made

### **❌ FAIL if:**
- Test 10A shows 5.0 seconds (wrong!)
- Validator shows "❌ NOT DETECTED"
- No corrections being made
- Overall pass rate <60%

---

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Azure CLI not found"**
```bash
brew install azure-cli  # macOS
```

### **"Not logged in"**
```bash
az login
```

### **"Module not found"**
```bash
cd /Users/ar616n/Documents/ios-app/backup-restore
npm install
```

### **"Validator not detected"**
```bash
# Restart Azure app
az webapp restart --name homework-helper-api --resource-group homework-helper-rg-f

# Wait 30 seconds, then run tests again
```

## 📚 **DETAILED DOCUMENTATION**

For complete details, see:
```
/Users/ar616n/Documents/ios-app/backup-restore/tests/README.md
```

---

## ✅ **QUICK VERIFICATION (30 seconds)**

```bash
# 1. Run tests
./run-automated-tests.sh

# 2. Check Test 10A
grep "Test 10A" test-results/QA_FINAL_REPORT.md

# 3. Check validators
cat test-results/latest-validator-analysis.txt

# Expected:
# ✅ Test 10A: PASS
# ✅ Validator: DETECTED
# ✅ Corrections: Made
```

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING**

### **If Tests Pass:**
1. ✅ Review which tests passed/failed
2. ✅ Check validator activity patterns
3. ✅ Identify weak areas for improvement

### **If Tests Fail:**
1. ❌ Check validator-analysis immediately
2. ❌ Review Azure logs for errors  
3. ❌ Debug specific failing tests

---

## 💡 **KEY POINTS**

1. **No iOS app needed** - Tests run through backend API
2. **Real Azure logs captured** - See exactly what validators do
3. **Automated verification** - Know if validators are working
4. **One command** - Super easy to run
5. **Comprehensive reports** - 5 different output files

---

## 🎉 **YOU'RE READY!**

Just run:
```bash
cd /Users/ar616n/Documents/ios-app/backup-restore/tests
./run-automated-tests.sh
```

Then check `test-results/latest-validator-analysis.txt` to verify validators are working!
