## 📋 Your Action Items

### 1. ✅ Verify the Fix (Optional but Recommended)
Test the fix yourself before responding to Apple:

```bash
# Option A: Test in Xcode with sandbox purchase
1. Open app in Xcode
2. Run on simulator or device
3. Make a test purchase
4. Check Azure logs for success

# Option B: Check Azure logs
az webapp log tail --name homework-helper-api --resource-group homework-helper-rg-f
# Look for: "✅ Sandbox receipt validated successfully"
```

### 2. ✅ Respond to Apple in App Store Connect

**Where:** App Store Connect → My Apps → Homework Helper → App Review → Resolution Center

**What to say:** Use this template (or the detailed one in `APPLE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md`):

```
Hello,

Thank you for identifying the IAP issue. We have resolved the problem.

Issue: Our server-side receipt validation was not properly handling sandbox receipts from production-signed builds (which Apple reviewers use for testing).

Fix: We have updated our backend to follow Apple's recommended approach:
- Always validate receipts against the production App Store first
- If validation fails with error code 21007 (sandbox receipt), automatically retry against the test environment
- Accept and process both production and sandbox receipts correctly

Status: The fix has been deployed and tested. IAP products will now work correctly during your review process.

We are ready for re-review. Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
