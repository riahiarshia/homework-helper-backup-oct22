# ✅ Token Tracking System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The token tracking system is now live and working! Every OpenAI API call will be automatically tracked and visible in the admin portal.

---

## 📊 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend Database (✅ Complete)**
- **Table:** `user_api_usage` - Stores every OpenAI API call
  - User ID
  - Endpoint (analyze_homework, generate_hint, verify_answer, chat_response, validate_image)
  - Model (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)
  - Token usage (prompt, completion, total)
  - Cost in USD (automatically calculated)
  - Metadata (problem ID, session ID, custom data)
  - Timestamp

- **Database Views for Analytics:**
  - `user_usage_summary` - Total usage per user
  - `monthly_usage_summary` - Monthly usage breakdown
  - `endpoint_usage_summary` - Usage by endpoint and model
  - `daily_usage_summary` - Daily usage trends

### 2. **Backend Services (✅ Complete)**
- **`usageTrackingService.js`** - Handles all tracking logic
  - Calculates costs based on OpenAI pricing
  - Stores usage in database
  - Provides analytics queries
  - Exports data to CSV

- **`openaiService.js`** - Integration points
  - `validateImageQuality()` - Tracks image validation calls
  - `analyzeHomework()` - Tracks homework analysis calls
  - `generateHint()` - Tracks hint generation calls
  - `verifyAnswer()` - Tracks answer verification calls
  - `generateChatResponse()` - Tracks chat API calls

### 3. **Backend API Routes (✅ Complete)**
- **`/api/usage/summary`** - Get user usage summary
- **`/api/usage/user/:userId`** - Get specific user's usage
- **`/api/usage/endpoint`** - Get usage by endpoint
- **`/api/usage/daily`** - Get daily usage statistics
- **`/api/usage/stats`** - Get overall platform statistics
- **`/api/usage/export`** - Export detailed CSV
- **`/api/usage/export/summary`** - Export summary CSV
- **`/api/admin/migrate-usage-tracking`** - Apply migration (admin only)

### 4. **Admin Portal (✅ Complete)**
- **📊 API Usage Tab** - New dedicated section showing:
  - Overall statistics (total calls, tokens, cost, active users)
  - Daily statistics (today's usage)
  - Monthly statistics (this month's usage)
  - Endpoint breakdown table
  - User usage table (sortable, filterable)
  - Export buttons for CSV downloads

### 5. **iOS App Integration (✅ Complete)**
- **Modified Files:**
  - `HomeworkHelper/Services/BackendAPIService.swift`
    - Added `userId` parameter to `validateImageQuality()`
    - Added `userId` parameter to `analyzeHomework()`
    - Sends userId in multipart form data
  
  - `HomeworkHelper/Views/HomeView.swift`
    - Passes `dataManager.currentUser?.userId` to backend calls
    - Logs userId for debugging

### 6. **Automatic Migration (✅ Complete)**
- **File:** `auto-migrate-on-startup.js`
- **Behavior:** 
  - Runs automatically when server starts
  - Checks if migration is needed
  - Applies migration if tables don't exist
  - Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

## 💰 Cost Tracking Details

### **Pricing per Model:**
- **GPT-4o-mini** (Default):
  - Input: $0.150 per 1M tokens
  - Output: $0.600 per 1M tokens
  
- **GPT-4o**:
  - Input: $2.50 per 1M tokens
  - Output: $10.00 per 1M tokens

### **Automatic Cost Calculation:**
Every API call automatically calculates:
```
Cost = (prompt_tokens × input_price) + (completion_tokens × output_price)
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Automatic Tracking Flow:**
```
1. Student uploads homework via iOS app
   ↓
2. iOS app sends userId + image to backend
   ↓
3. Backend calls OpenAI API
   ↓
4. OpenAI responds with result + usage data
   ↓
5. usageTrackingService.trackUsage() saves to database
   ↓
6. Data immediately visible in admin portal
```

### **What Gets Tracked:**
- ✅ Which user made the request
- ✅ Which API endpoint was called
- ✅ Which OpenAI model was used
- ✅ How many tokens were consumed
- ✅ What it cost in USD
- ✅ When it happened
- ✅ Optional metadata (problem ID, subject, grade level)
