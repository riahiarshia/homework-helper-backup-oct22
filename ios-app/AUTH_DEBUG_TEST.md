# 🔍 Authentication Debug Test

## What I Fixed:

1. ✅ Changed `AuthenticationView` to use `@EnvironmentObject` instead of creating its own `@StateObject`
2. ✅ Properly connected the shared `authService` instance throughout the view hierarchy
3. ✅ Added debug logging to track state changes

---

## 🧪 How to Test:

### Step 1: Run the App

In Xcode, press **⌘ + R** to run

### Step 2: Watch the Console

Open the **Console** in Xcode (View → Debug Area → Activate Console or **⌘ + Shift + C**)

### Step 3: Sign In with Google

1. Click "Continue with Google"
2. Complete Google Sign-In
3. **Watch the console output**

---

## 📊 What to Look For in Console:

You should see a sequence like this:

```
🔍 ContentView render: isAuthenticated = false, needsOnboarding = true
✅ Google Sign-In successful: your.email@gmail.com
📤 Sending authentication request to backend...
📥 Backend response: {...}
✅ Authentication successful!
   User ID: abc-123-def
   Email: your.email@gmail.com
   Subscription: trial
   Days remaining: 14
💾 User data saved
🔄 State updated: isAuthenticated = true
🔄 Current user: your.email@gmail.com
🔍 ContentView render: isAuthenticated = true, needsOnboarding = true  ← Should show onboarding
✅ Created new user in DataManager from auth
```

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior:

After signing in with Google:
1. Console shows `isAuthenticated = true`
2. Console shows `needsOnboarding = true` (for new users)
3. **App shows the Onboarding screen** (not login screen!)

---

## 🐛 If Still Showing Login Screen:

**Copy and paste the console output** and share it with me. Look for these key lines:

1. `🔄 State updated: isAuthenticated = true` ← This should appear
2. `🔍 ContentView render: isAuthenticated = true` ← This should appear after
3. Any error messages with ❌

---

## 🔍 Additional Debug Info:

The debug logs will tell us:
- ✅ If Google Sign-In completes
- ✅ If backend authentication succeeds  
- ✅ If state updates properly
- ✅ If ContentView sees the state change
- ✅ What view is being shown (login vs onboarding vs main)

---

## 💡 Most Likely Fixes If It Still Fails:

**Problem 1: State not updating**
- Console shows `isAuthenticated = true` but view doesn't change
- Fix: Force view refresh

**Problem 2: Backend error**  
- Console shows error from backend
- Fix: Check backend is running

**Problem 3: Token not saved**
- User signs in but session not persisted
- Fix: Check Keychain permissions

**Run the test now and let me know what you see in the console!** 🚀
