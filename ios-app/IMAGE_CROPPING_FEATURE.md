## 🎨 **Interface Details**

### **Limited Area Mode (Default/Recommended):**
- ✅ Shows green crop frame
- ✅ Dims areas that won't be analyzed (top/bottom)
- ✅ Highlights center 50% of image
- ✅ Blue info banner: "Focus on 1-2 problems"
- ✅ Green button: "Analyze Selected Area"

### **Full Image Mode:**
- ⚠️ Shows full image without cropping
- ⚠️ Orange warning banner: "May take longer and could timeout"
- ⚠️ Orange button: "Analyze Full Image"
- ⚠️ User explicitly chooses this option

---

## 📐 **Technical Details**

### **Crop Area:**
- **Width**: 100% (full width)
- **Height**: 50% (center area)
- **Position**: Starts at 20% from top
- **Dimming**: Top 20% and bottom 30% are dimmed

### **Why This Works Better:**
1. **Smaller file size** - Faster upload
2. **Less content** - AI processes faster
3. **More focused** - Better number recognition
4. **Fewer problems** - More accurate per problem
5. **Prevents timeout** - Stays under 60-second limit

---

## 🎯 **User Benefits**

### **For Students:**
- ✅ Faster processing (smaller images)
- ✅ More accurate results (focused content)
- ✅ Less likely to timeout
- ✅ Clear guidance on what to upload
- ✅ Still have option for full page if needed

### **Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Green** = Recommended (limited area)
