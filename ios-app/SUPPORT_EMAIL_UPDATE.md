## 🔐 Domain Setup (Optional)

If you want even more professional emails (remove "sent via sendgrid.net"):

### Domain Authentication (Recommended)

1. **In SendGrid:**
   - Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
   - Enter: `arshia.com`
   - Follow DNS setup instructions

2. **Add DNS Records:**
   - SendGrid will give you DNS records
   - Add them to your domain registrar
   - Wait for verification (can take 24-48 hours)

3. **Benefits:**
   - No "via sendgrid.net" tag
   - Better email deliverability
   - More professional appearance
   - Higher trust from email providers

**Note:** This is optional - single sender verification works fine for now!

---

## 💰 No Additional Cost

Using your custom email domain doesn't cost extra with SendGrid.

- Same free tier (100 emails/day)
- Same pricing for paid plans
- Just needs DNS configuration (if doing domain auth)
