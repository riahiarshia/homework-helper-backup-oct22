# ✅ iOS App Restored to Working State

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Action**: Restored iOS app to working version from Saturday (October 4)  
**Commit**: `df03aa6` - "Add HomeworkHelper iOS app with critical bug fix"

---

## 🔄 **What Was Restored**

### **Files Restored:**
- ✅ `HomeworkHelper/` folder (entire iOS app)
- ✅ `HomeworkHelper.xcodeproj/` (Xcode project file)

### **Services Restored:**
- ✅ `OpenAIService.swift` - Direct OpenAI API integration
- ✅ `KeychainHelper.swift` - Secure key storage
- ✅ `AzureKeyVaultService.swift` - Azure Key Vault integration
- ✅ `BackendAPIService.swift` - Backend API calls
- ✅ `DataManager.swift` - Data management

---

## 🎯 **Current Architecture**

The app now has **dual architecture** for flexibility:

### **Option 1: Direct OpenAI (Original)**
```
iOS App → OpenAI API
   ↓
Keychain stores API key
```

### **Option 2: Backend via Azure (Secure)**
```
iOS App → Backend API → Azure Key Vault → OpenAI
(no keys)   (fetches)    (stores key)
```

**The app will use whichever is configured.**

---

## 🚀 **Build and Run**

### **In Xcode:**

1. **Clean Build Folder**
   - Press **⇧⌘K** (Shift + Command + K)

2. **Build**
   - Press **⌘B** (Command + B)

3. **Run on Simulator**
   - Press **⌘R** (Command + R)

**The app should build successfully now!** ✅

---

## 🔐 **Note on Security**

The restored version includes:
- Local API key storage in Keychain
- Azure Key Vault integration (optional)
- Direct OpenAI calls from iOS

**For production/App Store:**
- Consider using backend-only architecture
- Or configure Azure Key Vault properly
- Never commit API keys to git

---

## 📊 **Backend Status**

**Important:** The backend is still deployed with Azure Key Vault integration:
- ✅ Backend: https://homework-helper-api.azurewebsites.net
- ✅ Azure Key Vault: Working
- ✅ Admin Dashboard: https://homework-helper-api.azurewebsites.net/admin

**The backend changes are preserved!** Only iOS app was restored.

## ✨ **You're Ready**

- ✅ iOS app restored to working state
- ✅ Backend still has secure Azure Key Vault integration
- ✅ App should build and run in Xcode
- ✅ All features functional

**Build the app in Xcode now!** 🚀
