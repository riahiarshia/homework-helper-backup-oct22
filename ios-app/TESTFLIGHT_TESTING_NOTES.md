- [ ] **Middle School (6-8):** Can introduce formulas with explanations
- [ ] **High School (9-12):** Should use proper mathematical notation

### **5. Hint System**
- [ ] Request hints during problem solving
- [ ] Verify hints are helpful but don't give away answers
- [ ] Check hints match appropriate grade level
- [ ] Test hints with visual/concrete examples for young students

## üé® **Animations & UI**

### **6. Launch Experience**

## üìù **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Simple Math Problem**
1. Upload image with 3-5 basic math problems
2. Work through ALL problems step by step
3. Verify final answers are correct
4. Test hints at each step

### **Scenario 2: Rectangle Perimeter (Grade Level Test)**
1. Upload geometry homework with rectangles
2. Set profile to Elementary (age 10)
3. Check if hints use "length + length + width + width"
4. Verify NO formulas like "2√ó(l+w)" appear

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Problem Worksheet**
1. Upload homework with 5+ problems
2. Verify app creates steps for EVERY problem
3. Count total steps = ~3-5 steps √ó number of problems
4. Ensure app doesn't finish until all solved

### **Scenario 4: Navigation Flow**
1. Start homework, complete 3 steps
2. Hit back button twice (should go to step 1)
3. Go forward to step 5
