## Resolution

We have identified and fixed the issue with in-app purchase availability. The problem was in our server-side receipt validation logic.

### Root Cause
Our backend was not properly handling the scenario where a production-signed app (like the one submitted for review) makes purchases in the sandbox environment (which Apple reviewers use for testing).

### Fix Implemented
We have updated our server-side receipt validation to follow Apple's recommended approach:

1. **Always validate receipts against the production App Store first**
2. **If validation fails with error code 21007** ("Sandbox receipt used in production"), we now **automatically retry against the test environment**
3. **Accept and process both production and sandbox receipts** correctly

This ensures that:
- ✅ Production users with real purchases work correctly
- ✅ Apple reviewers using sandbox IAP can test successfully
- ✅ TestFlight beta testers can make test purchases
- ✅ Xcode development testing continues to work

### Changes Made
- **File:** Backend server receipt validation endpoint
- **Change:** Implemented production-first validation with automatic sandbox fallback
- **Status:** Deployed and live
- **Date:** October 14, 2025

### Testing
We have verified that:
1. Sandbox receipts are now properly validated (error 21007 triggers sandbox retry)
2. Production receipts continue to work as expected
3. Both environments are correctly detected and logged
4. Subscription status is properly updated in all scenarios

## Additional Notes

### Paid Apps Agreement
- ✅ The Account Holder has accepted the Paid Apps Agreement in App Store Connect
- ✅ In-app purchases are configured and ready for production

### Sandbox Testing
- ✅ We have tested IAP functionality in the sandbox environment
- ✅ Products load correctly
- ✅ Purchase flow completes successfully
- ✅ Receipt validation works for both sandbox and production

### Server Configuration
- ✅ Backend is configured with Apple Shared Secret
- ✅ Receipt validation endpoints are operational
- ✅ Error handling is comprehensive
- ✅ Logging is in place for debugging

## Ready for Re-Review

The issue has been fully resolved. In-app purchases will now work correctly during Apple's review process, as our server properly handles sandbox receipts from production-signed builds.

We appreciate your patience and look forward to your re-review of the app.
