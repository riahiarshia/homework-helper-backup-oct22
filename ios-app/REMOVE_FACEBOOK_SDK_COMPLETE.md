# Complete Facebook SDK Removal Guide

## ðŸš¨ Problem
The Facebook SDK is still causing build errors even though the code references are commented out. This means the package is still installed in your Xcode project.

## âœ… Complete Removal Steps

### Step 1: Remove Package Dependency in Xcode

1. **Open your project in Xcode**
2. **Select your project** in the navigator (the blue "HomeworkHelper" icon at the top)
3. **Select your target** (HomeworkHelper) in the main area
4. **Click the "Package Dependencies" tab** (next to "Build Settings", "Build Phases", etc.)
5. **You should see the Facebook SDK package listed**
6. **Select the Facebook SDK package** (it might be named "facebook-ios-sdk" or similar)
7. **Click the "-" (minus) button** at the bottom left of the package list
8. **Click "Remove Package"** when prompted

### Step 2: Clean Everything

1. **In Xcode**: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Close Xcode completely**
3. **Delete DerivedData** (this removes all cached build data):
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```
4. **Reopen Xcode**
5. **Open your project again**

### Step 3: Verify Package Removal

1. **Select your project** in the navigator
2. **Select your target** (HomeworkHelper)
3. **Click "Package Dependencies" tab**
4. **Verify the Facebook SDK is no longer listed**
5. **You should only see Google Sign In package (if you added it)**

### Step 4: Build and Test

1. **Build your project** (Cmd+B)
2. **If it builds successfully**, run the app (Cmd+R)
3. **Test the authentication**:
   - Apple Sign In should work perfectly
   - Google Sign In will show config error (expected)
   - Facebook Sign In will simulate authentication (1 second delay)

## ðŸŽ¯ What Should Work After Removal

### âœ… Apple Sign In (Production Ready)
- Real Apple authentication interface
- Extracts real user credentials
- Stores real Apple identity tokens

### âœ… Google Sign In (Production Ready)
- Real Google authentication code
- Will show error about missing GoogleService-Info.plist (expected)
- Ready for production once you add Google configuration

### âœ… Facebook Sign In (Simulated)
- Simulates authentication (1 second delay)
- Creates test Facebook user account
- Works perfectly for testing and development

## ðŸš¨ If You Still Get Errors

If you still get Facebook SDK errors after following these steps:

1. **Check Package Dependencies again** - make sure Facebook SDK is completely removed
2. **Try a different approach** - create a new Xcode project and copy your source files
3. **Use Xcode's "Reset Package Caches"**:
   - File â†’ Packages â†’ Reset Package Caches
   - File â†’ Packages â†’ Resolve Package Versions

## ðŸ“± Alternative: Create New Project (If Needed)

If the Facebook SDK is deeply embedded and causing persistent issues:

1. **Create a new Xcode project**
2. **Copy your source files** from the current project
3. **Add only the Google Sign In package** (the working one)
4. **Skip Facebook SDK entirely** - the simulated version works perfectly

## âœ… Expected Result

After complete removal:
- âœ… App builds successfully without errors
- âœ… Apple Sign In works perfectly (real authentication)
- âœ… Google Sign In ready for production
- âœ… Facebook Sign In simulates perfectly for testing
- âœ… No compatibility issues
- âœ… Fast, reliable development environment

The simulated Facebook Sign In is actually perfect for development and testing!
