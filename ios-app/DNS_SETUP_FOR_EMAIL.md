# üìß DNS Setup for Email Sending (arshia.com)

## üéØ What You Need to Do

To send emails from `@arshia.com` domain, you need to add DNS records. Here's where and how:

---

## Step 1: Find Your DNS Provider

Your domain `arshia.com` is registered somewhere. Common providers:
- **GoDaddy**
- **Namecheap**
- **Google Domains** (now Squarespace)
- **Cloudflare**
- **Azure DNS**
- **AWS Route 53**

### How to Find It:

Check your email or billing records for:
- Domain renewal emails
- Where you purchased arshia.com
- Domain registrar notifications

**Or check here:**
- Log into your domain registrar account
- Look for "arshia.com" in your domains list

---

## Step 2: Get DNS Records from SendGrid

### In SendGrid Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Authenticate Your Domain"** (not "Verify a Single Sender")
3. Select:
   - **Domain:** `arshia.com`
   - **DNS Host:** Select your provider (or "Other")
4. Click **"Next"**

SendGrid will give you **3 types of DNS records:**

### A. CNAME Records (for DKIM)
```
Host: s1._domainkey
Value: s1.domainkey.u12345.wl.sendgrid.net
TTL: 3600

Host: s2._domainkey  
Value: s2.domainkey.u12345.wl.sendgrid.net
TTL: 3600
```

### B. TXT Record (for SPF)
```
Host: @
Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
TTL: 3600
```

### C. CNAME Record (for tracking - optional)
```
Host: em1234
Value: u12345.wl.sendgrid.net
TTL: 3600
```

   - TTL: Automatic
6. Repeat for each CNAME record
7. For TXT record:

2. Select arshia.com (if hosted there)
3. Click **"+ Record set"**

---

## Step 4: Verify in SendGrid

After adding DNS records:

1. Wait 5-10 minutes (DNS propagation)
2. Go back to SendGrid
3. Click **"Verify"** button
4. ‚úÖ SendGrid checks the DNS records
5. ‚úÖ Should show "Verified"!

---

## üîç Check Which Provider You Use

Run these commands to find out:

```bash
# Check nameservers
dig arshia.com NS +short

# Check registrar
whois arshia.com | grep -i registrar
```

**Or:** Check your email for domain renewal notices from the provider.

---

## üìã Simplified Option: Single Sender Verification

**If you don't want to deal with DNS:**

Instead of authenticating the whole domain, just verify a single email:

1. In SendGrid: **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"** (NOT "Authenticate Your Domain")
3. Use: `a.r@arshia.com` (your email)
4. Verify by clicking link in email
5. ‚úÖ Done! (No DNS needed)

**Trade-off:**
- ‚úÖ Easier (no DNS)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Emails show "via sendgrid.net"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly lower deliverability

## üéØ Recommendation

### For Testing (Quick - 2 minutes):
‚Üí Use **Single Sender Verification** with `a.r@arshia.com`

### For Production (Professional - 10 minutes):
‚Üí Use **Domain Authentication** with DNS records

**Which do you prefer?**
