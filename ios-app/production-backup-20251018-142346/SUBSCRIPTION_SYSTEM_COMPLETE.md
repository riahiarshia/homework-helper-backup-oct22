## 💰 Revenue Model

### Pricing Strategy:
- **$9.99/month** - Industry standard for education apps
- **7-day trial** - Proven conversion rate booster
- **Auto-renewable** - Recurring revenue
- **No annual option** (can add later)

### Expected Conversion:
- Industry average: **5-15%** trial-to-paid conversion
- Education apps: **10-20%** (higher engagement)
- With good UX: **15-25%** possible

### Revenue Calculation:
- 1,000 trial users
- 15% conversion = 150 subscribers
- 150 × $9.99 = **$1,498.50/month**
- Annual: **~$18,000**

### Track These Metrics:
1. **Trial starts** - New user signups
2. **Trial-to-paid** - Conversion rate

5. **MRR** - Monthly recurring revenue

### Where to Monitor:
- **App Store Connect** - Subscription analytics
- **Admin Portal** - User subscription status
- **Database** - Custom queries

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Launch:

1. ⚠️ **Add files to Xcode** (see Step 1 above)
2. ⚠️ **Test thoroughly** in simulator
3. ⚠️ **Configure App Store Connect** with real product
4. ⚠️ **Test with sandbox Apple ID**
