## üß™ Step 8: Testing Subscriptions in TestFlight

### CRITICAL: TestFlight Uses SANDBOX Mode!

**For testers to test purchases:**

   Settings ‚Üí [Name] ‚Üí Media & Purchases ‚Üí Sign Out
   ```

2. **Open your app from TestFlight**

3. **Navigate to subscription screen**

4. **Tap "Subscribe"**

5. **When prompted, sign in with SANDBOX test account**
   - Use the sandbox tester you created in App Store Connect
   - NOT their real Apple ID!

6. **Complete purchase** (no real charge in sandbox!)

---

## üìä Step 9: Monitor TestFlight Analytics

**App Store Connect ‚Üí TestFlight tab ‚Üí Testers:**

You can see:
- ‚úÖ Who installed the app
- ‚úÖ Which builds they're testing
- ‚úÖ Crash reports
- ‚úÖ Feedback from testers

---

## üîç Step 10: Verify Subscriptions Work

### Check Backend:

```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  subscription_status,
  apple_environment,
  apple_product_id,
  subscription_end_date
FROM users 
WHERE apple_environment = 'Sandbox'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Expected for TestFlight testers:**
- `apple_environment` = "Sandbox" ‚úÖ
- `subscription_status` = "active" ‚úÖ
- `apple_product_id` = "com.homeworkhelper.monthly" ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No products found"

**Cause:** Subscription not approved yet or product ID mismatch

**Solution:**
- Wait for subscription approval in App Store Connect
- Verify product ID matches exactly: `com.homeworkhelper.monthly`
- Check subscription is available in all countries

### Issue 2: "Cannot connect to iTunes Store"

**Cause:** Tester using real Apple ID instead of sandbox

**Solution:**
- Sign OUT of real App Store
- Use sandbox test account when purchasing

### Issue 3: Build not appearing in TestFlight

**Cause:** Processing takes time or build didn't meet requirements

**Solution:**
- Wait up to 30 minutes
- Check email for processing errors
- Ensure all required capabilities are enabled

### Issue 4: Subscription shows as "Sandbox" but should be "Production"

**This is CORRECT!** TestFlight always uses sandbox mode for subscriptions!

---

## üöÄ Step 11: Iterate & Update

### When you make changes:

1. **Increment build number** in Xcode
2. **Archive** again
3. **Upload** to App Store Connect
4. **Wait for processing**
5. **Testers automatically get update** notification
