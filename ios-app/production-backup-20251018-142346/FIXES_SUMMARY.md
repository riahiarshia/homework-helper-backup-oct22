# ✅ Fixes Applied - Summary

## 🎯 What I Just Fixed

### 1. Backend "age" Column Error ✅ DEPLOYED

**Problem:** Backend was crashing with `column "age" does not exist`

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified: `backend/routes/auth.js`
- Removed references to non-existent `age` column
- Committed: `ab7c036`
- Pushed to GitHub: ✅
- **Auto-Deploy Status:** GitHub Actions will deploy automatically to Azure (3-5 min)

**Deployment Details:**
- App Service: `homework-helper-api.azurewebsites.net`
- Resource Group: `homework-helper-rg-f`
- Branch: `main`
- Method: GitHub Actions (auto-deploy enabled)

**How to Verify:**
- Wait 3-5 minutes
- Check Azure portal → App Service → Deployment Center
- Or watch logs: Backend errors should stop

### 2. Subscription Configuration - Intro Offer Removed ✅

**Problem:** Users getting 14 days total (7 backend + 7 Apple intro offer)

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified: `HomeworkHelper/Configuration.storekit`
- Removed Apple's 7-day introductory offer
- **Now:** Backend gives 7 days, purchase gives 30 days immediately

**Before:**
```
Sign up → 7 days backend trial
Purchase → ANOTHER 7 days from Apple intro offer
Then → 30 days monthly subscription
Total: 14 days free ❌
```

**After:**
```
Sign up → 7 days backend trial
Purchase → 30 days monthly subscription immediately
Total: 7 days free ✅
```

**Status:** Ready for testing (needs Xcode steps)

### 3. Subscription Validation Enhancement ✅

**Problem:** App only checked database, not Apple's actual subscription status

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified: `HomeworkHelper/Services/SubscriptionService.swift`
- Added `checkCurrentEntitlements()` method
- App now checks StoreKit for active subscriptions on launch
- Revalidates receipt with backend automatically

**How It Works Now:**
```
App Launch
  ↓
Check StoreKit for Active Subscriptions
  ↓
If Found: Revalidate Receipt with Backend
  ↓
Backend Updates Database from Apple
  ↓
App Shows Correct Status
```

**Status:** Ready for testing (needs Xcode steps)

## 📋 What YOU Need to Do Next

### ⏰ Wait 3-5 Minutes
Backend is deploying via GitHub Actions. Check status:
- Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
- App Service → homework-helper-api → Deployment Center
- Wait for "Success" status

### 📱 Then Follow This Test Plan:

Open this file: **`SUBSCRIPTION_TEST_PLAN.md`**

**Quick Steps:**
1. Clear StoreKit cache in Xcode
2. Reset StoreKit configuration  
3. Clean build
4. Delete app and reinstall
5. Create brand new test user
6. Purchase subscription
7. **Watch console for expiration time**
8. Check database

**Success Criteria:**
- Console shows **5 minutes** between purchase and expiration ✅
- Database shows **~5 minutes** duration ✅
- In production, this = **30 days** subscription ✅

## 📊 Files Changed

### Backend (Auto-Deploying):
```
backend/routes/auth.js - Removed age column reference
```

### iOS App (Ready to Test):
```
HomeworkHelper/Configuration.storekit - Removed intro offer
HomeworkHelper/Services/SubscriptionService.swift - Added StoreKit validation
```

---

## 🧪 Sandbox Time Reference

Remember when testing:

| Production | Sandbox | What It Means |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 7 days | 3 minutes | Old intro offer (should not see this) |
| 30 days | 5 minutes | Monthly subscription (should see this) ✅ |

**If you see 5 minutes in console logs → Success!** That represents 30 days in production.

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Still Showing Age Error:
```bash
# Manually trigger deployment:
cd /Users/ar616n/Documents/ios-app/ios-app/backend
az webapp deployment source sync --name homework-helper-api --resource-group homework-helper-rg-f
```

### Still Showing 3 Minutes (7 Day Trial):
StoreKit cache issue. Follow the "Nuclear Option" in `SUBSCRIPTION_TEST_PLAN.md`

### Purchase Fails:
- Make sure signed OUT of real App Store
- Delete all transactions: Debug → StoreKit → Manage Transactions

## 📞 Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend fix - DEPLOYED (wait 3-5 min)
2. ⏳ iOS testing - **Follow SUBSCRIPTION_TEST_PLAN.md**
3. 📊 Report results - Time difference from console logs

**Start testing in Xcode after backend deploys!** 🚀
