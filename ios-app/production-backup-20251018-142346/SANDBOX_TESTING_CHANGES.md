# Sandbox Subscription Testing - Changes Summary

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Issue:** The app had a DEBUG mode bypass that prevented real StoreKit sandbox testing. When you added a sandbox test user to App Store Connect, the app couldn't actually use it because the purchase flow was being simulated instead of using real StoreKit.

**Solution:** Removed DEBUG bypasses and enabled proper StoreKit sandbox testing with enhanced logging.

---

## 📝 Files Changed

### 1. `/HomeworkHelper/Views/PaywallView.swift`

**What Changed:**
- Removed the `#if DEBUG` bypass that was simulating purchases
- Now uses the real StoreKit purchase flow in both DEBUG and production
- Added sandbox environment detection helper

**Before:**
```swift
#if DEBUG
// TestFlight bypass - simulate successful purchase
print("🧪 TestFlight/DEBUG mode - simulating successful purchase")
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.0) {
    self.isPurchasing = false
    self.dismiss()
}
#else
// Production purchase flow
Task {
    let success = await subscriptionService.purchase()
    // ...
}
#endif
```

**After:**
```swift
// ALWAYS use real StoreKit flow (works with sandbox and production)
// Sandbox testing requires the actual purchase flow
Task {
    print("🛒 Starting purchase flow...")
    print("🛒 Environment: \(isSandbox ? "Sandbox" : "Production")")
    
    let success = await subscriptionService.purchase()
    // ...
}
```

**Impact:** Users can now test real Apple sandbox subscriptions in DEBUG mode.

### 2. `/HomeworkHelper/Services/SubscriptionService.swift`

**What Changed:**
- Removed TestFlight bypass in `loadProducts()` that was skipping product loading
- Added extensive logging throughout purchase flow
- Added helpful sandbox testing tips in error messages

**Key Changes:**

#### A. Product Loading
**Before:**
```swift
// TestFlight bypass - skip product loading in TestFlight
if isTestFlight {
    print("🧪 TestFlight detected - bypassing product loading")
    isLoading = false
    return
}
```

**After:**
```swift
// Request products from App Store (works in both sandbox and production)
print("📦 Requesting product ID: \(monthlySubscriptionID)")
let products = try await Product.products(for: [monthlySubscriptionID])

if products.isEmpty {
    print("⚠️ No products found for ID: \(monthlySubscriptionID)")
    print("⚠️ For sandbox testing, ensure Configuration.storekit file is selected")
} else {
    print("✅ Loaded subscription product: \(products.first?.displayName ?? "Unknown")")
    if isTestFlight {
        print("🧪 SANDBOX MODE - Ready for testing with sandbox Apple ID")
    }
}
```

#### B. Purchase Flow Logging
Added detailed logs at each step:
```swift
print("🛒 Environment: \(isTestFlight ? "Sandbox" : "Production")")
print("🛒 Product ID: \(product.id)")
print("🛒 Price: \(product.displayPrice)")

if isTestFlight {
    print("🧪 SANDBOX: You should see Apple's sandbox purchase dialog")
    print("🧪 SANDBOX: Use your sandbox test account (not your real Apple ID)")
}

// After successful purchase:
print("✅ Transaction ID: \(transaction.id)")
print("✅ Product ID: \(transaction.productID)")
print("✅ Purchase Date: \(transaction.purchaseDate)")
```

#### C. Error Troubleshooting
Added helpful tips when errors occur:
```swift
if isTestFlight {
    print("🧪 SANDBOX ERROR TROUBLESHOOTING:")
    print("   1. Sign OUT of App Store in Settings > App Store")
    print("   2. When prompted during purchase, sign in with sandbox account")
    print("   3. Make sure sandbox account is set up in App Store Connect")
    print("   4. Check that product ID matches in Configuration.storekit")
}
```

**Impact:** Much easier to debug sandbox testing issues with clear, actionable console logs.

## 🔄 How the Flow Works Now

### Complete Purchase Flow:

1. **App Starts:**
   ```
   📦 Loading products...
   📦 Environment: Sandbox/TestFlight
   📦 Requesting product ID: com.homeworkhelper.monthly
   ✅ Loaded subscription product: Monthly Premium
   ```

2. **User Taps Subscribe:**
   ```
   🛒 Purchase() called
   🛒 Environment: Sandbox
   🛒 Product ID: com.homeworkhelper.monthly
   🛒 Price: $9.99
   🧪 SANDBOX: You should see Apple's sandbox purchase dialog
   ```

3. **Apple Shows Dialog:**
   - Title: "Confirm Your In-App Purchase"
   - Subtitle: **"[Sandbox Environment]"** ← Key indicator!
   - User signs in with sandbox test account

4. **Transaction Processing:**
   ```
   ✅ Purchase successful, verifying transaction...
   ✅ Transaction verified
   ✅ Transaction ID: 2000000123456789
   🧪 SANDBOX: Transaction successful in sandbox environment
   ```

5. **Backend Validation:**
   ```
   🍎 Sending receipt for validation to backend...
   🔍 Receipt validation response status: 200
   ✅ Receipt validated by backend
   ✅ Purchase complete!
   ```

6. **Database Updated:**
   - `subscription_status = 'active'`
   - `apple_original_transaction_id` set
   - `apple_product_id = 'com.homeworkhelper.monthly'`
   - `apple_environment = 'Sandbox'`
