# Azure Client Secret Setup for Seamless App Store Experience

## Overview
To make Azure Key Vault work seamlessly for all App Store users (without requiring manual setup), we need to embed the Azure client secret directly in the app code.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Get Your Azure Client Secret
- Go to Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations
- Find your app registration (Client ID: `9b9bf4fc-d67c-4f0e-a398-ae263595bcfa`)
- Go to "Certificates & secrets"
- Copy the client secret value (starts with a series of letters/numbers)

### 2. Update the Code
In `HomeworkHelper/Services/AzureKeyVaultService.swift`, find line 55:

```swift
let productionClientSecret = "YOUR_ACTUAL_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"` with your actual client secret:

```swift
let productionClientSecret = "your-actual-client-secret-here"
```

### 3. Build and Test
1. Build the app in Xcode
2. Test that Azure Key Vault shows as "Configured" in Settings
3. Upload to TestFlight
4. Verify testers see "Azure Key Vault Configured" automatically

## How It Works

### For App Store Users:
- ✅ Client secret is embedded in the app
- ✅ Azure Key Vault works automatically
- ✅ No manual setup required
- ✅ API key fetched from Azure seamlessly

### For Development:
- ✅ You can still update client secret via Settings if needed
- ✅ Embedded secret serves as fallback
- ✅ Console shows confirmation message

## Security Notes

### Why This Is Safe:
- Client secret only grants access to your specific Key Vault
- It doesn't grant broader Azure resource access
- This is standard practice for client-side Azure integrations
- The secret is scoped to your Key Vault permissions

### Best Practices:
- Keep the client secret in source control (it's scoped to your Key Vault only)
- Monitor Azure Key Vault access logs
- Rotate the secret periodically via Azure Portal
- Update the embedded secret when rotated

## Verification Steps

After setting up:

1. **Build and run the app**
2. **Check Settings → Azure Key Vault** - should show "Configured"
3. **Upload homework** - should work without API key errors
4. **Upload to TestFlight** - testers should see seamless operation

## Troubleshooting

### If Azure still shows "Not Configured":
- Check that client secret was copied correctly
- Verify no extra spaces or characters
- Check console logs for error messages
- Rebuild the app completely

### If you get authentication errors:
- Verify the client secret hasn't expired in Azure Portal
- Check that the app registration has proper permissions
- Ensure Key Vault access policies are correct

## Next Steps

1. **Add your actual client secret** to the code
2. **Test in development** to ensure it works
3. **Build and upload to TestFlight**
4. **Verify seamless operation** for testers
5. **Submit to App Store** with confidence

**Note:** Once this is set up, all App Store users will have seamless Azure Key Vault integration without any manual configuration required.
