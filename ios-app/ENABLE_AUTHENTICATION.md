# Enable Authentication in HomeworkHelper

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Build is now working** - The app builds successfully without authentication errors.

The authentication code is currently commented out to prevent build failures. To enable the full authentication system, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Add Authentication Files to Xcode Project

1. **Open Xcode Project**:
   ```bash
   open HomeworkHelper.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Add AuthenticationService.swift**:
   - Right-click on **Services** group in Project Navigator
   - Select "Add Files to 'HomeworkHelper'"
   - Navigate to: `HomeworkHelper/Services/AuthenticationService.swift`
   - Ensure "Add to target: HomeworkHelper" is checked
   - Click "Add"

3. **Create Authentication Group**:
   - Right-click on **Views** group
   - Select "New Group"
   - Name it **"Authentication"**

4. **Add Authentication Views**:
   - Right-click on the **Authentication** group
   - Select "Add Files to 'HomeworkHelper'"
   - Navigate to: `HomeworkHelper/Views/Authentication/`
   - Select all three files:
     - `AuthenticationView.swift`
     - `SignInView.swift`
     - `SignUpView.swift`
   - Ensure "Add to target: HomeworkHelper" is checked
   - Click "Add"

## Step 2: Enable Authentication Code

After adding the files to Xcode, uncomment the authentication code:

### In ContentView.swift:
- Uncomment lines 5, 16-23, 27-39, 67, 71-75
- Remove the temporary `if needsOnboarding` condition

### In SettingsView.swift:
- Uncomment line 6 (authService environment object)
- Uncomment lines 98 (email display)
- Uncomment lines 138-143 (Authentication section)
- Uncomment lines 264-271 (Sign out alert)

### In DataManager.swift:
- Uncomment lines 29-34 (updateUserFromAuth method)
- Remove the `setupDefaultUser()` call from `init()`

## Step 3: Test Authentication

1. **Build the project** (‚åò+B)
2. **Run the app** (‚åò+R)
3. **Test the authentication flow**:
   - App should show authentication screen first
   - Try email/password sign-in
   - Test social login buttons (simulated)
   - Verify sign-out functionality

## Authentication Features

Once enabled, the app will have:

### üîê **Authentication Options**
- Email/Password sign-in and sign-up
- Apple Sign In (simulated)
- Google Sign In (simulated)
- Facebook Sign In (simulated)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- Secure token storage in Keychain
- Input validation
- Session management
- Automatic sign-out

### üë§ **User Experience**
- Beautiful authentication screens
- Demo account for testing
- Password reset functionality
- Profile management

## Files Added to Project

The following files need to be added to the Xcode project:
- `HomeworkHelper/Services/AuthenticationService.swift`
- `HomeworkHelper/Views/Authentication/AuthenticationView.swift`
- `HomeworkHelper/Views/Authentication/SignInView.swift`
- `HomeworkHelper/Views/Authentication/SignUpView.swift`

## Testing

### Demo Account
- Email: `demo@homeworkhelper.com`
- Password: `demo123`

### Social Login
- Currently simulated (would need real OAuth implementation)
- Buttons are functional for testing UI

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure all files are added to the **HomeworkHelper** target
2. Check that file paths are correct in the project navigator
3. Clean build folder (‚åò+Shift+K) and rebuild
4. Restart Xcode if needed

## Next Steps

After enabling authentication:
1. Test all authentication flows
2. Verify user data persistence
3. Test sign-out and data clearing
4. Consider implementing real OAuth for social login
5. Add backend integration for production use

The authentication system is fully implemented and ready to use once the files are added to the Xcode project!
