# Google Sign In Setup Guide

## Overview
I've implemented real Google Sign In functionality to replace the simulated version. The app will now properly contact Google's servers and present the actual Google Sign In interface.

## What's Changed
- ✅ Real Google Sign In SDK integration
- ✅ Proper authentication flow with Google's servers
- ✅ URL callback handling for sign in completion
- ✅ Error handling for authentication failures
- ✅ Configuration validation with helpful warnings

## Setup Steps Required

### 1. Add Google Sign In SDK to Project
You need to add the Google Sign In SDK to your Xcode project:

1. **Open your project in Xcode**
2. **File → Add Package Dependencies**
3. **Enter URL**: `https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS`
4. **Click "Add Package"**
5. **Select "GoogleSignIn"** and click "Add Package"

### 2. Create Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the **Google Sign-In API**
4. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**

### 3. Configure OAuth Client
1. **Application type**: iOS
2. **Bundle ID**: Use your app's bundle identifier (e.g., `com.yourcompany.homeworkhelper`)
3. **Download the configuration file** (`GoogleService-Info.plist`)

### 4. Add Configuration File
1. **Drag the downloaded `GoogleService-Info.plist`** into your Xcode project
2. **Make sure it's added to the target**
3. **Verify it's in the project bundle** (should appear in Xcode's project navigator)

### 5. Configure URL Scheme
Add the URL scheme to your `Info.plist`:

1. **Open `Info.plist`**
2. **Add new entry**: `URL types`
3. **Add URL scheme**: Use the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` from your `GoogleService-Info.plist`

Example:
```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>GoogleSignIn</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Implemented Features
- Real Google Sign In SDK integration
- Proper error handling
- URL callback handling
- Configuration validation
- User profile extraction

### ⚠️ Still Needed
- Google Sign In SDK package dependency
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` configuration file
- URL scheme configuration in Info.plist

## Testing

### Before Setup (Current State)
- Clicking "Continue with Google" shows "Signing in..." but nothing happens
- This is because the SDK isn't installed and configured yet

### After Setup
- Clicking "Continue with Google" will open the real Google Sign In interface
- User can select their Google account
- App will receive real user information (name, email)
- Authentication will complete successfully

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GoogleService-Info.plist not found"**
   - Make sure the file is added to your Xcode project
   - Verify it's included in the app target

2. **"Unable to present sign in interface"**
   - Check that URL scheme is configured in Info.plist
   - Verify bundle ID matches Google Cloud configuration

3. **Sign in opens but fails**
   - Check that OAuth client is configured for iOS
   - Verify bundle ID matches exactly

### Debug Information
The app now provides helpful debug messages:
- ✅ "Google Sign In configured successfully" - Everything is set up correctly
- ⚠️ "GoogleService-Info.plist not found" - Configuration file missing
- ⚠️ "Unable to present sign in interface" - URL scheme or presentation issue

## Next Steps

1. **Add the Google Sign In SDK** to your project
2. **Set up Google Cloud project** and OAuth client
3. **Add the configuration file** to your project
4. **Configure URL scheme** in Info.plist
5. **Test the authentication flow**

Once these steps are completed, the "Continue with Google" button will work properly and present the real Google Sign In interface!
