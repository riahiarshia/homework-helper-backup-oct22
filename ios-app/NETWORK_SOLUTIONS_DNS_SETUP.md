```

## Step 4: Add Records in Network Solutions

### For Each CNAME Record:

   ```
4. Click **"Add"** or **"Save"**

```

Should show the SendGrid values you added.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Network Solutions Specific Notes

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: TTL too long**
- Network Solutions might set TTL to 1 day by default
- Change to 3600 (1 hour) for faster updates

**Issue 2: Automatic domain appending**
- Network Solutions might add ".arshia.com" automatically
- If host field shows: `s1._domainkey.arshia.com`
- Just enter: `s1._domainkey` (it adds the rest)

**Issue 3: Multiple DNS editors**
- Network Solutions has "Basic DNS" and "Advanced DNS"
- Use **"Advanced DNS"** for CNAME records
- Basic DNS might not show all record types

---

## üöÄ Simpler Alternative: Single Sender Verification

**If DNS seems complicated**, you can skip domain authentication and just verify a single email:

### Quick Option (No DNS Required):

1. In SendGrid: **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Verify a Single Sender"** (not "Authenticate Your Domain")
3. Use email: `a.r@arshia.com`
4. Check your email and verify
5. ‚úÖ Done! (Takes 1 minute)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ No DNS configuration needed
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Emails show "via sendgrid.net" 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can only send from verified email addresses

**For production:** Domain authentication is better
**For testing/MVP:** Single sender is fine
