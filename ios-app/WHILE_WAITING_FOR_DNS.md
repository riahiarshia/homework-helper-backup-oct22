# ⏰ While Waiting for DNS Propagation

You've added DNS records to Network Solutions - great! Now while we wait...

## ✅ What We Can Do NOW

### 1. Configure Azure with SendGrid API Key

I need your **SendGrid API Key** to configure Azure right now.

**Where to get it:**
1. In SendGrid dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Name: `HomeworkHelper`
5. Permission: **"Full Access"**
6. Click **"Create & View"**
7. **Copy the key** (looks like `SG.abc123...`)

**Give me the API key** and I'll:
- Add it to Azure configuration
- Set the sender email
- Restart the backend
- Everything will be ready when DNS finishes!

### 2. Test Password Reset WITHOUT Email

While waiting for DNS, we can still test the full password reset feature using tokens:

**Current Test User:**
- Email: `a.r@arshia.com`
- Password: `testpass123`

**Test Flow:**
1. Request password reset in app (generates token)
2. I get the token from database
3. Open reset form with deep link
4. You enter new password
5. Sign in with new password
6. ✅ Everything works except email delivery!

---

### 3. Prepare for SendGrid Configuration

**What I'll configure in Azure:**

```bash
# Environment Variables
SENDGRID_API_KEY = (your API key)
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL = support_homework@arshia.com
APP_URL = homeworkhelper://
```

**When DNS finishes propagating:**
- ✅ SendGrid validates your domain
- ✅ Emails start sending automatically
- ✅ No code changes needed!

---

## 📊 Timeline

**Right Now (0 minutes):**
- ✅ DNS records added to Network Solutions
- ⏳ Waiting for propagation

**Now + 5 minutes (if you give me API key):**
- ✅ Azure configured with SendGrid
- ✅ Backend restarted
- ⏳ Still waiting for DNS

**Now + 1-24 hours (DNS propagates):**
- ✅ DNS records active
- ✅ SendGrid domain verified
- ✅ Emails start sending!
- 🎉 Everything works!

## 🎯 Next Steps for You

### Immediate (Now):

1. **In SendGrid:**
   - Settings → API Keys
   - Create API Key
   - Copy it
   - **Paste it here in chat**

2. **Confirm:**
   - What sender email did you add DNS for?
   - `support_homework@arshia.com` or different?

### Then I'll Do:

1. Configure Azure with your API key
2. Set sender email
3. Restart backend
4. Test the configuration

### Later (1-24 hours):

1. Check if DNS propagated:
   ```bash
   dig s1._domainkey.arshia.com CNAME +short
   ```
2. Go to SendGrid → Verify domain
3. ✅ Should be verified!
4. Test email sending
5. 🎉 Fully working!

## 🧪 What We Can Test Right Now

Even without email sending, we can test:

✅ Registration (creates user in Azure DB)  
✅ Login (authenticates with Azure DB)  
✅ Password reset token generation  
✅ Password reset form (deep linking)  
✅ Actual password change in database  
✅ Sign in with new password  

Only missing:
⏳ Email delivery (waiting for DNS + SendGrid config)

## 📧 Paste Your SendGrid API Key

**Format:**
```
SG.abcdefg1234567890_very_long_string_here
```

Once you paste it, I'll configure Azure immediately! 🚀

**While you're getting the API key, your iOS simulator is still running with the app if you want to test other features!**

What's your SendGrid API key?
