**You need access to `support_homework@arshia.com` email to verify it!**

### Options:

- Set up email forwarding or mailbox for `support_homework@arshia.com`

- Use your personal email for testing
- For example: `your.name@gmail.com`
- I can update the backend to use that instead

**Option C - Use SendGrid's sandbox mode:**
- Can send to verified test emails only
- Good for testing before domain setup
