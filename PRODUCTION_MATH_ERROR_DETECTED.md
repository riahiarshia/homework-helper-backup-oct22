## 📝 Problem Details

### **User's Question:**
"A bag has 3 red, 2 green, 4 blue marbles. Find the probability of getting 1 red, 1 green, and at least 1 head."

### **System's Answer:**
- First step correct answer: **1/10** ❌
- Last step correct answer: **1/10** ❌

### **Actual Correct Answer:**
**1/8** ✅

## 🔍 Correct Calculation

### Step 1: Probability of drawing 1 red and 1 green marble (without replacement)
- Total marbles: 3 red + 2 green + 4 blue = **9 marbles**

**Two possible orders:**
1. **Red first, then green:**
   - P(red) = 3/9
   - P(green | red drawn) = 2/8
   - Combined: (3/9) × (2/8) = 6/72

2. **Green first, then red:**
   - P(green) = 2/9
   - P(red | green drawn) = 3/8
   - Combined: (2/9) × (3/8) = 6/72

**Total probability:** 6/72 + 6/72 = **12/72 = 1/6**

### Step 2: Probability of at least 1 head in 2 coin flips
- P(at least 1 head) = 1 - P(no heads)
- P(no heads) = (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4
- P(at least 1 head) = 1 - 1/4 = **3/4**

### Step 3: Combined probability
- P(both events) = P(marbles) × P(coins)
- P(both events) = (1/6) × (3/4)
- P(both events) = **3/24 = 1/8** ✅

## ❌ What Went Wrong

The system calculated **1/10** instead of **1/8**.

### Possible Error Sources:
1. **Marble calculation error:** May have calculated (3/9) × (2/9) = 6/81 ≈ 0.074 instead of considering both orders
2. **Combination formula misapplication:** May have used incorrect combinatorics
3. **Order confusion:** May have not accounted for "red then green" AND "green then red"

### The Error:
If the system calculated:
- P(red and green) = (3/9) × (2/8) = 6/72 = 1/12 (only one order)
- P(at least 1 head) = 3/4
- Combined: (1/12) × (3/4) = 3/48 = 1/16 ❌ (still not 1/10)

OR possibly:
- P(red and green) = (2/9) × (2/8) = 4/72 = 1/18 (wrong)
- Some other calculation to get 1/10

**Need to investigate the actual OpenAI response to see what calculation it performed.**

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### 1. **Add Probability Validator** (High Priority)
Add a new validator in `openaiService.js` to catch common probability errors:
- Check if probabilities are between 0 and 1
- Validate "without replacement" calculations
- Verify "at least one" complement calculations
- Check combinatorics formulas

### 2. **Math Verification Step** (Medium Priority)
- For numeric answers in math problems, add automated verification
- Use a math library to double-check calculations
- Flag discrepancies > 10% for review

### 3. **Enhanced System Prompt** (Low Priority)
- Add explicit instructions for probability problems
- Emphasize "without replacement" vs "with replacement"
- Include examples of "at least one" problems
